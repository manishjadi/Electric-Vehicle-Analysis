# Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes the **Electric Vehicle Population Data** to identify key trends in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, performance, and distribution across different regions and time periods. The analysis covers data from 2010 to 2024, focusing on factors such as **vehicle make**, **model**, **electric range**, and **registration details**. The goal is to derive insights that can help **manufacturers**, **policymakers**, and **consumers** make informed decisions about the electric vehicle market.

## Key Features
- Analyze the distribution of electric vehicles by **make**, **model**, and **region**.
- Explore **trends** in electric vehicle adoption over time.
- Understand improvements in **electric range** across different **model years**.
- Visualize the geographic distribution of EVs across **states**.
- Compare the **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV)** to **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)** population.
- Perform predictive analysis to forecast **electric range** and other key metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following key columns:
- **Model Year**: The year the vehicle was manufactured.
- **Make**: The manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet).
- **Electric Range**: The range (in kilometers or miles) a vehicle can travel on a full charge.
- **Vehicle Type**: Whether the vehicle is a **BEV** (Battery Electric Vehicle) or **PHEV** (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle).
- **Registration Date**: The date when the vehicle was registered.
- **State**: The U.S. state where the vehicle is registered.
